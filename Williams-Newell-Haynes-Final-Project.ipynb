    "For this project, we decided to use different AI game playing algorithms on checkers to see which ones play the best. For the rules of checkers, visit [this website](https://www.itsyourturn.com/t_helptopic2030.html). We chose the following four game playing algorithms: minimax, negamax, reinforcement learning with temporal difference and reinforcement learning with a neural network. Additionally, we created a board python class to represent the board for the game handling all of the game playing mechanics like picking a valid move, making a move, determining if the game is over, etc. After implementation, we proceeded to run the algorithms against opponents who choose random moves and then the other game playing algorithms to see which one would come out on top.\n",

If it is occupied and can be jumped and hasn't already been added to a jump pattern, it will check for extra jumps by checking the left and right positions again recursively.

These functions will both train and use a `Q` dictionary that stores the a `Board` state move tuple as the key to a number that represents the potential game outcome of making that particular move for that exact scenario. The higher the number, the better that move is for the AI. Our reinforcement is a little bit different than the reinforcement learning we saw in class. This algorithm back propagates a reinforcement throughout every move that led to that state, so that moves early in the game still recieve a value. Also, we significantly reduce the size of the `Q` table by storing just moves, rather than a state move tuple. Checkers has 500 billion billion possible states, not including state move tuples. We aslo did this because moves hold interesting information about the game, such as jumping another piece, getting kinged, etc. due to the way they are represented in the board class, and so that AI can extrapolate the usefulness of the move based on the outcome of the game."

    "## Observations\n",
    "There were some interesting observations along the way that led to structuring our reinforcement AI the way we did. First of all, we saw that using state move tuples worked just fine and the AI would beat the random with state move tuples as the keys to the `Q` dictionary. However, upon inspection there were way too many states and `Q` was very sparse after training, with often only values for less than 10% of all entries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first method we tried to solve this was to back propagate the reinforcement with a very low decay rate so that the reinforcement would reach the opening move. However, these states were never used because there were too many to ever get a hit on the table. So how was that AI winning? Well, `numpy.argmax` in the `greedy` function takes the first valid move, so the strategy was inadvertantly to move the first piece possible up and to the left if it could, and never to move the last row. Since black could never move into the last row and make a king, it runs out of valid moves and the AI would win. \n",
    "\n",
    "To try and reduce this strategy and allow `Q` to actually contain some semblance of a strategy, we reduced `Q` to only contain the move selected. The move has inherent state involved, such as where it is moving from, the spaces it will jump, and the end position. This seemed to be enough to allow the AI to still ~98-99% of the time against a random opponent. This way we could look at the Q dictionary and see the values for the moves it selected. It still used the strategy of avoiding moving out of the back row if it could, but at times would jump a piece that had gotten close. It also really valued moving up the board as much as possible to try and get a king. If these moves were available they were often chosen, which could be a residual impact of the `numpy.argmax` usage we discussed earlier. Finally, it's winning strategy after observing many games. It tries it's best to get as many kings as possible, and leaves it's back row completely full, thus blocking the opponent from making any kings. Once it has kings and black has no kings, the opponent will inevitably run out of moves, and the AI will win the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Possible Research\n",
    "Some interesting thoughts we had along the way and after discussing was using a smart test subject to train against. When looking at the moves made, the AI will take risks because a random opponent will rarely select the right move that would punish that risk, such as moving up the board and being vulnerable for a jump. It has one thing in mind: getting a king. To try and prevent foolish behavior such as this, a smarter training opponent could be added that would punish the AI by jumping it when it could. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting idea is to use a neural net to determine the reinforcements. Possible reinforcements could be jumping pieces, getting kings, favoring the sides as opposed to the middle, and not moving off the back wall. If weights were determined through a neaural net for these reinforcements, the AI could be much smarter, and produce more accurate reinforcements for certain moves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we thought that it would be interesting to represent the keys to the `Q` dictionary in different ways. One could include a localized board section, where selecting the locally optimum would hopefully result in the global optimum. Another could be recognizing similar board patterns and using those patterns with move types (normal, jump, king, etc) as inputs into the dictionary. The point of changing how keys are represented is to reduce the number of states, while still maintaining a decently accurate `Q` dictionary."

    "Checkers is a zero-sum game, meaning the payoff for each player at the end of the game is equal and opposite. For this reason, adversarial search algorithms like `minimax` and `negamax` can be used to play the game of checkers. Through a process similar to a depth first search, the algorithms search through each possible move from the initial player. Then, from each of these moves, the algorithm searches each move from there for the opposing player. Once the depth limit or leaf nodes are reached, the utility is returned and the player chooses the move that optimizes their utility. From there, in the next recursion up, that player chooses it's optimum move and so on. This process results in one of the key components of adversarial search algorithms, each player assumming the other is playing optimally. Both of the two adversarial search algorithms, `minimax` and `negamax` follow this same process. The way they differ is in how players' utility is determined, which will be explained below."

If the depth limit is reached, a simple heuristic is used to see who has the advantage. All of the pieces for each player will be counted, with kings counting as two.

    "Alpha beta pruning is a technique used in adversarial search algorithms to limit the number subtrees that need to be searched. It does this by taking the best value found so far for one player, represented by the variable `alpha`, and comparing it to the best value found so far for the other player, represented by the variable `beta`. If `alpha` is ever greater than `beta`, all other subtrees at that level do not need to be searched and can be pruned because, even if they were to be searched, they would not be chosen by the algorithm. To explain further, even though the current node may have chosen a value in the pruned subtree, the node above the current is guarenteed to not choose anything in that subtree since it has already found a better value in a previous subtree. As a result, cutting off these subrees saves a lot of time.\n",

    "The implementation of alpha beta pruning is simple for `minimax`. First, The parameters `alpha` and `beta` are added to the funtion with `alpha` always representing the best value for the maximizer and `beta` always representing the best value for the minimizer. Inside the function, if the current player is the maximizer, after a value and a move is returned by the recursive call to `minimax`, the current best value found is compared to `alpha`. If `bestValue` is greater than `alpha`, `alpha` will be set to `bestValue`. If the current player is the minimzer, however, the current best value is compared to `beta` and if `bestValue` is less than `beta`, `beta` is set to `bestValue`. Finally, following this process for both the maximizer and minimizer, `alpha` is compared to `beta` and if `alpha` is greater than `beta`, a `break` statement is used and no more of the moves for that specific state are checked."

    "First of all, time is a serious issue for these adversarial search algorithms. Without alpha beta pruning they run for an incredibly long time in the order of hours. As a result, alpha beta pruning is essentially a requirement for these algorithms as it cuts down the runtime immensely. However, even with the addition of alpha beta pruning, time is still a big issue for these adversarial search algorithms. Running an entire game against an opponent who chooses random moves still takes around 30 minutes, since most moves for each player need to be searched and there are 10<sup>20</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Setting a depth limit and heuristic is also important for this problem since it saves a lot of time. However, the use of the depth limit could potentially lead to a move that isn't optimal being chosen, but the heuristic does its best in the attempt to choose what it sees as the best move once the depth limit is reached. Additionally, the depth limit must be chosen wisely. A lower depth limit will result in faster run time but a higher depth limit allows the algorithm to search deeper into the game, therefore giving it a higher likelyhood of choosing a good move. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to an issue encountered in the application of adversarial search to checkers. If the depth limit is low, when it is reached not enough has happened yet in the game for the heuristic to decide who has an advantage, and a utility of 0 is returned since both sides have an even amount of pieces. The utility being 0 happens for much of the first half of the game before a player is deemed to have an advantage, and, while bad moves are still avoided, the algorithm stll chooses the first of potentially many moves with a 0 utility possibly missing an optimum move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue observed due to the heuristic was sometimes a player seemed to decide to capture another piece just to get the piece count to be equal or in their favor, even if that capture is not the best move to do. As described earlier, the first half of the game is spent with the utility being 0 since both sides have an equal piece count. One potential reason for this is a player choosing to capture a piece to achieve the 0 utility when it would have a -1 utility (1 if the player is the minimizer in minimax) by not capturing. When looking at the board at these times, the capture seems illogical, but is still chosen because of the piece count reason. This same phenomenon is observed closer to the end of the game when an advantage can be derived. Seemingly illogical captures still take place just so the player will still have a greater piece count. However, even though these moves seem illogical from the onset because they lead to immediate capture of the origional piece or merely result in a perceived disadvantage, maybe prioritzing capturing and piece count is a worthwile stategy to consider in a checkers game."

    "There is some further research that could be done for these adversarial search algorithms, most of which relating to speed. One of the biggest things that could be improved is creating a better heuristic. With a improved heuristic that can determine advantage earlier in the game with more levels of utilities, a wider range of values will be found earlier on. This would inevetably result in more pruning of subtrees since there will be more than just the five utility values of -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 to compare. Additionally, the heuristic could be improved allowing for a prioritization of certain types of moves. For example, capturing or kinging could be prioritized if the utility would otherwise be the same. Even not moving certain pieces could be prioritized like not moving pieces in the back row. Statistics keeping on certain moves could also be done in an attempt to remember what moves are good, in a manner similar to reinforcement learning. This way, with knowledge of the statistics, certain moves could be chosen over others if the utility is otherwise the same."

    "##  Introduction To Reinforcement Learning With Neural Networks\n",
    "This section of the notebook details the implementation of a checkers playing neural network using reinforcement learning.  Reinforcement learning teaches computers how to play certain games much like how you would teach an animal using classical conditioning. Say I wanted to teach my dog how to go fetch the newspaper. One strategy would be to let her into the front yard, and if she brings back the newspaper give her a big treat. Another might be to gradually teach her, by maybe throwing the newspaper as if it was a toying and giving her treats when she brings it back, or giving her treats when she runs up to the newspaper. Of course punishments for incorrect behavior could be used as well, but this doesn’t work very well with my dog, who is a wild spirit. Reinforcement learning for computers works in the same way. Here, we are trying to learn the game of checkers. One strategy would be to give reinforcements along the way for each enemy piece captured, or for forming certain formations that are favored by expert checkers players. But these methods can lead to biases and might prevent the AI from learning new, novel ways of winning. So instead this AI is only given a reinforcement when it wins and a negative reinforcement when it doesn’t. This is like only giving your dog a treat when they bring back the newspaper. This sparse reinforcement might make it hard to learn at first, but allows for more flexibility in terms of picking up strategies. In addition it simplifies the code greatly, because the only condition that is checked for to give reinforcements is a win or a loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we implemented reinforcement learning using a Q dictionary. This means that each state in the game of checkers is saved, and reinforcements are doled out to each individual state. If you want to find out the value of a move, you simply find what it's Q value is in the dictionary entry for the relevant state and move pair. This implementation uses a neural network instead. See the definition of neural networks. Here we use the state and move pair as input to the neural network, and a Q value representing the value of the move as the output of the network. This has an advantage over the Q table approach because we can get output from the Q network for state,move pairs that haven’t been encountered before. The table has no way of knowing what sort of value to assign to new states. One drawback when compared to the Q table approach is that the network must train for much longer to obtain any sort of proficiency, and the sparseness of reinforcement makes it very difficult for the network to learn what states lead to wins or losses. This also makes the programming of the training more complicated. The strategy used here is to play a certain number of games in a row x and to save up the outcomes in a list. Then after that amount of games is played, feed them into the neural network to train it to recognize what moves led to a loss or a victory in that batch of games. This process is then repeated over y batches, the idea being that after each batch it would become better at the game and win more of the matches. (This didn’t actually hold up to well, I think it has to do with either the number of iterations being too high and the variables going whack, or maybe an issue with my code, but I didn’t find anything.)When training the neural net, many different network structures and training strategies are used in order to find the most effective one. \n"

    "\n",
    "The implementation of neural network based reinforcement learning is made in NeuralReinforcement.py. This file has the following methods:\n",
    "* `epsilonGreedy(Qnet, state, epsilon)`\n",
    "* `finished(state)`\n",
    "* `trainQnet(nBatches, nRepsPerBatch, hiddenLayers, nIterations, nReplays, epsilon, epsilonDecayFactor)`\n",
    "* `useQ(Qnet, maxSteps, printResult = False)`\n",
    "* `testQ(Qnet, trials, maxSteps = 1000, printResult = False)`\n",
    "* `plotOutcomes(outcomes, binRate = 10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`epsilonGreedy(Qnet, state, epsilon)` takes a Qnet neural network object, the state as a Board object, and the value for epsilon as a number from 0 to 1. `epsilonGreedy` is a function that either takes a random move or the move decided by Qnet based on the value of epsilon. If a randomly generated number is less than `epsilon`, the function just returns a randomly selected move from the valid moves given by `state`. Otherwise, it decides using `Qnet`. Every valid move in the given `state` is passed in along with `state` as input the the neural network `Qnet`, then the move with the highest output is selected as the best move and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "`finished(state)` simply takes a state and returns a boolean for whether the game is finished or not based on the number of valid moves remaining for the given player.\n",
    "\n",
    "`trainQnet(nBatches, nRepsPerBatch, hiddenLayers, nIterations, nReplays, epsilon, epsilonDecayFactor)` is the most complicated method in the file. It takes:\n",
    "* `nBatches` which represents the number of batches to train the neural network with.\n",
    "* `nRepsPerBatch` which represents the number of games to play per batch to train with.\n",
    "* `hiddenLayers` gives the structure of the neural network in the list form [#HiddenUnitsInLayer1, #HiddenUnitsInLayer2, ..., #HiddenLayerUnitsInLayern].\n",
    "* `nIterations` is the number of iterations on which to train the neural net.\n",
    "* `nReplays` is the number of replays to used for training, but I never got around to using it in the scope of this project.\n",
    "* `epsilon` gives the initial epsilon, or amount of random moves, to be used for training. \n",
    "* `epsilonDecayFactor` is the amount to decay `epsilon` by for each batch in `nBatches`\n",
    "\n",
    "The method works in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, initialize 68 to 1 neural network with `hiddenLayers` structure as well as variables to store training information\n",
    "* For the number of batches in `nBatches`\n",
    "    * If after the first batch, decay epsilon. Create a list to hold the samples\n",
    "    * For number of repititions in `nRepititions`\n",
    "        * Take a first move given by `epsilonGreedy`\n",
    "        * While the game is not finished:\n",
    "            * Create variables for the new state and move and initialize reinforcement and Q values\n",
    "            * If the game is finished, set positive reinforcement for game.\n",
    "            * Otherwise, let black take a move and see if they win. If they do, add a negative reinforcement. \n",
    "            * At the end, add the game and reinforcement to samples\n",
    "            * Then, take the `epsilonGreedy` move and move new state and moves to the old ones. \n",
    "    * Train the neural net on the information gathered after the previous repititions. \n",
    "* Return Qnet\n",
    "\n",
    "* `useQ(Qnet, maxSteps, printResult = False)` plays a game using the greedy choices based on Qnet against a random opponent with `maxSteps` as a cutoff. If printResult is True, it also returns a list of states. Otherwise it returns 0 or 1 for a loss or a win. \n",
    "* `testQ(Qnet, trials, maxSteps = 1000, printResult = False)` calls `useQ` for number of trails to roughly estimate the performance of Qnet against a random opponent.\n",
    "* `plotOutcomes(outcomes, binRate = 10)` plots the outcomes of training a neural network. "

Next we verify that there isn't a bias in checkers that leads red to win to see if the 99% win rate is notable. We play random moves against each other to check to see that red wins around 50% of the time."

    "The samples above show only some of the structures I tried. The very fist call I made was with this (30, 100, [50, 50, 50], 20, 0, 1, .99) call. This produced a valid neural network which won a measly 55.85% of the time after an hour and a half of training. But because I had done trails with `randomQ` I knew that the network had learned something. I looked through the code and found a few bugs that would improve my run time, including a bug that meant I was accidentally training for both black and red players. But even with that and different network structures, the networks could not do much better than a 60% win rate when called with the same other parameters. What I eventually found was that tweaking the number of iterations, batches and reps could actually make a large difference in effectiveness. Very low batch and iteration counts, like 2 and 10 respectively in conjuction with high rep counts in the hundreds of games gave much more effective training. This is counter intuitive, as it almost negates the role of epsilon decay factor as the first few games are essentially random moves. However, this strategy resulted in the most effective results."

    "The first setback I had was with getting some sort of code to run on the GPU. I had figured it would be a simple matter of changing a few lines of code to work with pytorch tensors, but I found it to be more complex than that. Looking back, I should have tried a few simple cases with writing my own neural net code in pytorch to more fully grasp the difference between that and the class neural network code. \n",

    "The next observation I had was with implementing the code. What was difficult here was determining what I was actually training the neural network on and what values it needed to target. I found that training was more successful with very few batches, most likely because of the number of iterations used to train the neural network. \n",

    "The biggest setback I had was probably due to time. Training these networks takes awhile on the GPU, so trying out many different large structures was not easy or feasible to do. In the end I tried a few smaller structures and guessed about what my be an effective large structure to see how it would tun. In the end it seemed to be fairly effective, winning a large portion of games consistently. "
